# Linux: Heap-Based Type Confusion in L2CAP (CVE-2020-12351)
BLE implementation of **Linux: Heap-Based Type Confusion in L2CAP** PoC (CVE-2020-12351)

## Why did I modify the original PoC?
The original [PoC][Andy Nguyen, Google Security Research Team] is focused on sending a malicious l2cap packet via Bluetooth Classic. However, I had a requirement to test it against a peripheral that supports only Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication. 

L2CAP is a common protocol that resides in host stack to support both bluetooth classic and BLE implementations


## Prerequisite
Linux Machine with BLE Adapter. If the machine doesn't come with an inbuilt adapter, you can a get an external one

## Usage: 
```sh
1. Compile 
gcc -o CVE-2020-12351 CVE-2020-12351.c -lbluetooth 

2. Run
$./CVE-2020-12351 <BLE_Peripheral_MAC_Address>      //MAC Format: FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF

Packet capture:
hcidump -i <hci0> -w CVE-2020-12351.pcap
```
